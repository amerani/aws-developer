# S3 (Simple Cloud Storage Service) 

- object based storage (not block based)
- data is spread across multiple devices
- 0 to 5TB file size
- globally unique namespace 
`https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bucket-name`
- 99.99% availability
- 11 9s durability 

## data consistency
- initial PUT - read after write
- update PUT and DELETE - eventual consistency

## concepts/features
- key (name of file)
- value (sequence of bytes)
- version id
- metadata
- subresources (bucket policies, access control list, CORS)
- transfer acceleration
- encryption

## Storage Tiers
- S3: high availability, high durability
- S3-IA: infrequently accessed, retrieval fee
- S3-One Zone IA: less available, not resilient to loss of AZ
- Reduced Redundancy Storage: least durable, for data that can be recreated
- Glacier: archival only, 3-5 restore

## Charges
- storage per GB
- request
- storage mgmt (inventory, object tags, analytics)
- data mgmt (data out, data in is free)
- transfer acceleration (CloudFront)

## Security
- all new buckets are private by default
- bucket policies: bucket level
- access control list: object level

## S3 Policies

Bucket Policy
- use policy generator
- Principal: IAM userame, ARN, `*` for public

## S3 Encryption

### In Transit
- SSL/TLS

### At Rest
- SSE-S3 (Server Side Encryption S3 Managed Keys)
- SSE-KMS (AWS Key Mangement Service, Managed Keys)
- SSE-C (Server Side Encryption with Customer Provided Keys)
- Client Side Encryption (encrypted upload)

### Enforcing 
- specify header to inform s3 to encrypt at upload time
- enforce via bucket policy to reject when header is not provided
- `x-amz-server-side-encryption: AES256` - SSE-S3
- `x-amz-server-side-encryption: ams:kms` - SSE-KMS
- PUT also fails with different encryption

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "Policy1535599951039",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1535599949394",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::alek-s3-encrypt/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringNotEquals": {
                    "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## CORS (cross origin resource sharing)
- must use endpoint url for static website
```xml
<CORSConfiguration>
    <CORSRule>
        <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
        <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
        <MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
        <AllowedHeader>Authorization</AllowedHeader>
    </CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```

## S3 Performance Optimization

GET intensive workload
- CloudFront

Mixed workloads
- random key names allows spreading IO workload across physical partitions
- especially concurrent PUT/DELETE

*not really an issue with July 2018 update*
