# Kinesis
- streaming data generated by thousands of sources simultaneously (ex purchases on amazon.com, stock prices)

## Streams
- stored in shards for 24hr - 7 days
- ec2 consumers
- data capacity = number of shards
- total capacity = sum of capacities of shards

## Firehose
- no shards
- automated capacity management
- optionally analyze in real time, no consumers needed
- sent directly forward to s3, redshift, elastic search
- no retention

## Analytics
- run sql queries as existing in kinesis
- send forward to s3, redshift, elastic search
